## Description

Trello doesn't maintain the horizontall scrollbar position of your boards. And it's annoying to navigate to the exact position you left your trello boards. Well, Scrollo is here for the rescue. It will keep track of your horizontall scrollbar position and will restore it when you open the board again.

## Inspiration
